    "title": "The Minority Rule and the Spread of Evil",
    "section": "",
    "text": "It is not uncommon to feel depressed and lost when you read social media feeds these days. There is bad news everywhere, and it often feels like the world is coming to an end and that evil people have finally won. One argument is that news outlets gravitate toward negativity and the public is more attracted to shocking stories than uplifting ones. While that may be true, my focus here is different: I am interested in why evil people so often seem to have their way even though most people are good and kind.\nNicholas Taleb’s idea of the minority rule, from his book Skin in the Game, helps explain this. The minority rule illustrates how intolerance often triumphs and how small, inflexible groups can dictate outcomes for the majority.\n\nExamples of the Minority Rule\n\nMost soft drinks are kosher, despite only 3–4% of consumers insisting on it.\n\nAirplanes and schools have become peanut-free, despite the majority having no allergies.\n\nMuch of the meat in the UK is halal, even though only a minority requires it.\n\nIn many families, children with disruptive behavior often get their way because everyone else submits to their preferences “for peace.” These are all examples of how the majority adjusts to the demands of a persistent minority.\n\n\nApplying the Minority Rule to the Spread of Evil\nEvil or harmful individuals are a minority, yet the world can look like a vast crime scene. This is because those who do harm are often highly persistent and willing to take enormous risks to achieve their ends. Like the unruly child, they do not care about peace — they care about getting their way.\nGood people, by contrast, are tolerant and conflict-averse. They tend not to take big risks for their goodness unless they have skin in the game. This creates an asymmetry: the minority who perpetrate evil are inflexible and often fearless, while the majority who are good are much more passive.\nGood people are still the majority, and it always pays to do good. But evil will continue to spread unless good people are willing to take risks in defense of goodness. The most effective way to confront evil is not to avoid it — but to fight it."

    "title": "Why Good Policies Fail in Democracies and What It means for Developing Countries",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I don’t know about you, but I often get frustrated with democracy. I like the idea behind it, and I still believe it is a better system of government than the alternatives, especially for countries that are already developed. But watching democratic politics in practice, can sometimes feel exhausting, if not discouraging.\nRecently, my frustration has grown from a simple question: why does it feel so hard for democracies to act, even when the problems are clear and the solutions seem reasonable? Governments argue for years over broken schools, border security, poor infrastructure, healthcare cost, crime and security, and rising cost of living. Even when good solutions exist, they are delayed, watered down, or blocked entirely. It seems to me that in democracy, good policy often loses to good politics.\n\nWhy Good Policies Fail in Democracies\nThe reason is not that democracies lack ideas or expertise. It is that democracy rewards political behavior that maximizes electoral advantage, not policy effectiveness.\nPoliticians must win elections. Parties must mobilize supporters. Interest groups must protect influence. Every policy choice is filtered through a political question: How will this affect my chances of staying in power? Even leaders who genuinely support a policy may step back if it risks angering key voters, empowering rivals, or disrupting fragile coalitions.\nAs a result, democratic politics creates a constant tension. On one hand, it encourages negotiation, debate, and compromise. On the other hand, it turns nearly every issue into a contest over advantage and control—even when the policy solution is already known and broadly supported.\nPolicies stop being about solving problems and start becoming signals: signals of loyalty, identity, and partisan positioning. What matters is not only whether a policy works, but whether it helps or hurts in the next election. This is why democracies can struggle to act decisively. The failure is not accidental. It is built into the system.\n\n\nWhen Delay Is Manageable and When It Is Not\nThis does not mean democracy is broken beyond repair. But it does mean we should be honest about its weaknesses. A system that encourages constant debate and competition also produces conflict and delay.\nFor countries that are already developed, this trade-off may be tolerable. Slow decision-making is frustrating, but basic institutions are in place. Roads exist. Schools function, even if imperfectly. Courts operate. Public administration works. The costs of delay are real, but they are often manageable.\nThe question becomes much harder when we shift our attention to developing countries.\n\n\nIs Democracy Good for Developing Countries That Need to Move Fast?\nIn many developing countries, the problems are not marginal—they are foundational. Infrastructure is missing. Public services are weak. State capacity is still being built. In these contexts, delay is not just inconvenient; it can be devastating.\nWhen basic needs are unmet, the ability to act quickly matters. Building roads, expanding electricity, enforcing tax systems, or reforming public administration often requires decisive and coordinated action. Autocratic systems can sometimes deliver these changes faster because power is centralized and opposition is limited.\nThis does not mean autocracy is better. History shows that concentrated power is easily abused. Corruption can become entrenched. Mistakes can be large and difficult to reverse. Citizens often have few ways to hold leaders accountable when things go wrong.\nStill, the comparison is uncomfortable. Democracy’s strengths like openness, competition, restraint, can become weaknesses when urgent action is needed. Elections, coalition politics, and constant bargaining can slow reforms to a crawl, even when the direction is widely agreed upon.\nDeveloping countries therefore face a difficult trade-off. They need speed to build institutions, but they also need accountability to prevent abuse. Democracy offers legitimacy and voice, but often at the cost of decisiveness. Autocracy offers speed, but at the cost of freedom and correction.\n\n\nWhat the Title Really Means\nThere are no easy answers here. The point is not to argue against democracy, nor to praise autocracy. It is to question the assumption that one political system works equally well in all contexts and at all stages of development.\nGood policies fail in democracies not because democracy is irrational, but because it is structured around electoral competition rather than problem-solving. For developed countries, this may be an acceptable cost. For developing countries, the same delay can be far more damaging.\nDemocracy remains a powerful ideal. But understanding its limits, especially its tendency to turn policy into electoral strategy, helps explain why progress can feel so slow, and why frustration with democratic politics is not just emotional, but structural."

The Political Economy of Corruption Prosecution Outcomes in Nigeria\nThis paper studies the determinants of outcomes of corruption prosecution using original data on more than two decades of corruption prosecution cases in Nigeria. I assess how the financial resources available to the defendants (operationalized by the monetary value of the funds allegedly stolen or misappropriated by the defendants) and their socio-economic standings influence whether they are convicted, acquitted, or have their cases stalled.\n\n\n\n2. Anti-corruption or Weaponization? The Politics of Anti-Corruption Prosecution in Nigeria\nAnti-corruption efforts are often presented as impartial actions designed to promote accountability and dis-incentivize corruption. In practice, however, they can be politi- cized and selectively enforced to serve partisan ends. This paper provides systematic evidence of such dynamics in Nigeria. Drawing on an original dataset of corruption allegations, investigations, and prosecutions involving high-level public officials in Nigeria, I examine how party affiliation and ties to the ruling president influence the decision on who gets prosecuted and the outcomes of prosecutions."

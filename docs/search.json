    "text": "Do you remember the famous quote: “when life gives you lemons, make lemonade”? It works as the perfect one-sentence summary of Ryan Holiday’s The Obstacle Is the Way. Inspired by ancient lessons from Stoicism, the book offers a framework for turning challenges into opportunities for growth and success.\nAccording to Holiday, obstacles are not just things to get past—they are the path itself. There is no success without difficulty, and the presence of obstacles is often a sign that we are doing something meaningful. Our job is to focus on what we can control and let go of what we cannot.\nHoliday structures the book around three core ideas: Perception, Action, and Will.\n\nPerception is how we see and interpret events. Holiday urges us to see problems objectively rather than emotionally, and to separate the facts from the stories we tell ourselves.\nAction is about our response to obstacles. It is the energy, creativity, and persistence we bring to breaking down challenges and turning them into opportunities.\nWill is the inner strength that helps us endure hardship, accept what we cannot change, and keep going even when outcomes are uncertain."

    "text": "Welcome\nI am a PhD candidate in Political Science at Tulane University. My ongoing dissertation project examines the political consequences of anti-corruption politicization. I study how governments use anti-corruption agencies (ACAs) strategically—sometimes to genuinely reduce corruption, and other times, to punish rivals and protect allies—and how these actions shape the behavior of political elites and citizens.\nMy broader research agenda spans comparative politics, African political economy, and public policy, with a regional focus on Nigeria and Africa. I work extensively with original and administrative data on corruption prosecutions, public opinion, political behavior, and governance outcomes, and I mostly use quantitative methods, causal inference tools, and mixed-methods approaches (including interviews, archival data, survey experiments).\nIn my other ongoing projects, I am examining the political economy of corruption prosecution outcomes in Nigeria, African public opinion on great-power competition in Africa, and government–NGO relations in Nigeria. My works have been published in peer-reviewed journals including Policy & Internet, Protest, World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, and GSC Advanced Research and Reviews.\nBefore graduate school, I held policy and data analytics roles in France, South Africa (remote), and Nigeria, including positions at SCOR Reinsurance and the African Leadership Academy. These experiences continue to inform my interest in evidence-based public policy and the design of institutions that promote government accountability and good governance."

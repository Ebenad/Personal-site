    "text": "It is not uncommon to feel depressed and lost when you read social media feeds these days. There is bad news everywhere, and it often feels like the world is coming to an end and that evil people have finally won. One argument is that news outlets gravitate toward negativity and the public is more attracted to shocking stories than uplifting ones. While that may be true, my focus here is different: I am interested in why evil people so often seem to have their way even though most people are good and kind.\nNicholas Taleb’s idea of the minority rule, from his book Skin in the Game, helps explain this. The minority rule illustrates how intolerance often triumphs and how small, inflexible groups can dictate outcomes for the majority.\n\n\n\nMost soft drinks are kosher, despite only 3–4% of consumers insisting on it.\n\nAirplanes and schools have become peanut-free, despite the majority having no allergies.\n\nMuch of the meat in the UK is halal, even though only a minority requires it.\n\nIn many families, children with disruptive behavior often get their way because everyone else submits to their preferences “for peace.” These are all examples of how the majority adjusts to the demands of a persistent minority.\n\n\n\nEvil or harmful individuals are a minority, yet the world can look like a vast crime scene. This is because those who do harm are often highly persistent and willing to take enormous risks to achieve their ends. Like the unruly child, they do not care about peace — they care about getting their way.\nGood people, by contrast, are tolerant and conflict-averse. They tend not to take big risks for their goodness unless they have skin in the game. This creates an asymmetry: the minority who perpetrate evil are inflexible and often fearless, while the majority who are good are much more passive.\nGood people are still the majority, and it always pays to do good. But evil will continue to spread unless good people are willing to take risks in defense of goodness. The most effective way to confront evil is not to avoid it — but to fight it."

    "text": "Ebenezer O. Makinde\nPhD Candidate in Political Science\nTulane University\n\n✉️ Email\n\n💼 LinkedIn\n\n💻 GitHub\n\n📚 Google Scholar\n\n\n\nWelcome!\nEbenezer O. Makinde is a PhD candidate in Political Science at Tulane University. My ongoing dissertation project examines the political consequences of anti-corruption politicization. I study how governments use anti-corruption agencies (ACAs) strategically—sometimes to genuinely reduce corruption, and other times, to punish rivals and protect allies—and how these actions shape the behavior of political elites and citizens.\nMy broader research agenda spans comparative politics, African political economy, and public policy, with a regional focus on Nigeria and Africa. I work extensively with original and administrative data on corruption prosecutions, public opinion, political behavior, and governance outcomes, and I mostly use quantitative methods, causal inference tools, and mixed-methods approaches (including interviews, archival data, survey experiments).\nIn my other ongoing projects, I am examining the political economy of corruption prosecution outcomes in Nigeria, African public opinion on great-power competition in Africa, and government–NGO relations in Nigeria. My works have been published in peer-reviewed journals including Policy & Internet, Protest, World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, and GSC Advanced Research and Reviews.\nBefore graduate school, I held policy and data analytics roles in France, South Africa (remote), and Nigeria, including positions at SCOR Reinsurance and the African Leadership Academy. These experiences continue to inform my interest in evidence-based public policy and the design of institutions that promote government accountability and good governance."

    "text": "Published Papers\n\nWhere are the ethics? AI and the digital economy in Nigeria\nPolicy & Internet (2025), with M. Alakitan\nThis article investigates the ethical and governance challenges that accompany the rapid expansion of digital technologies and AI systems in Nigeria. We identify gaps in regulatory oversight and data protection that expose citizens to privacy violations and other digital harms. The paper argues for a stronger ethical and policy framework to guide responsible AI adoption in Nigeria’s public and private sectors.\nRead Article\n\n\n\nLeveraging artificial intelligence for enhanced tax fraud detection in modern fiscal systems\nGSC Advanced Research and Reviews (2024), with K.O. Ariyibi, O.F. Bello, T.F. Ekundayo, O.I. Oladepo, and I.U. Wada\nThis paper examines how artificial intelligence (AI) can strengthen modern tax administration by improving the detection and prevention of tax fraud. Drawing on machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing techniques, the review evaluates how AI systems identify suspicious patterns and anomalies far more accurately than traditional rule-based methods, with some jurisdictions reporting up to an 85% improvement in fraud detection rates.\nRead Article\n\n\n\nHarnessing artificial intelligence to optimize financial technologies for achieving sustainable development goals\nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews (2024), with O. Elias, S.D. Esebre, I. Abijo, M.T. Adesina, T.D. Babayemi, O.I. Oladepo, and I.E. Fatoki\nThis paper reviews how artificial intelligence is transforming financial technologies (FinTech) in ways that advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It highlights how machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision enhance financial inclusion, improve credit scoring and risk assessment, strengthen fraud detection, and expand access to financial services—particularly in underserved populations.\nRead Article\n\n\n\nInternational political contexts, digital technologies, and political outcomes in Nigeria’s #EndSARS movement\nProtest (2024), 4(1), 5–29\nWhen do social movements achieve political outcomes? Existing research points to two key explanations: movements’ organizational infrastructure and the political opportunities structure. Focusing on the 2020 #EndSARS protest in Nigeria, I build on this literature to understand how and why social movements may achieve policy outcomes when social movements’ infrastructure and domestic political opportunities are relatively absent. Read Article\n\n\n\nWorking Papers\n\nWho Gets Convicted? The Political Economy of Corruption Prosecution Outcomes in Nigeria\nThis paper studies the determinants of outcomes of corruption prosecution using original data on more than two decades of corruption prosecution cases in Nigeria. I assess how the financial resources available to the defendants (operationalized by the monetary value of the funds allegedly stolen or misappropriated by the defendants) and their socio-economic standings influence whether they are convicted, acquitted, or have their cases stalled.\n\n\n\nAnti-corruption or Weaponization? The Politics of Anti-Corruption Prosecution in Nigeria\nAnti-corruption efforts are often presented as impartial actions designed to promote accountability and dis-incentivize corruption. In practice, however, they can be politi- cized and selectively enforced to serve partisan ends. This paper provides systematic evidence of such dynamics in Nigeria. Drawing on an original dataset of corruption allegations, investigations, and prosecutions involving high-level public officials in Nigeria, I examine how party affiliation and ties to the ruling president influence the decision on who gets prosecuted and the outcomes of prosecutions."

Our job is to focus on what we can control and let go of what we cannot.\nHoliday structures the book around three core ideas: Perception, Action, and Will.\n\nPerception is how we see and interpret events. Holiday urges us to see problems objectively rather than emotionally, and to separate the facts from the stories we tell ourselves.\nAction is about our response to obstacles.

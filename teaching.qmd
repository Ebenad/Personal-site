# Teaching Experiences

I have had the opportunity to teach and serve as a teaching assistant for courses in comparative politics, research methods, and quantitative methods at Tulane University.  In my teaching roles, I try my very best to offer clear explanations of core concepts, provide structured guidance and practice in quantitative and computational social science, and help students connect abstract theories to real-world cases, especially in African politics, public policy, and political economy.


## 1. Instructional Roles

### 1.1 Political Institutions, Ethnic Conflict, and Fiscal Policy  
**Lecture Instructor**, Introduction to Comparative Politics  
  Tulane University, Spring 2024  

Delivered a guest lecture module, in my capacity as a teaching assistant for Introduction to Comparative Politics, on how political institutions and ethnic cleavages shape conflict dynamics and fiscal policy choices in different countries. The session combined theoretical frameworks with empirical examples from Africa, Latin America and other regions, and introduced students to key debates in comparative political economy.
